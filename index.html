        <p>Join Tim Sabat and Tim Holman at <a href="https://developdenver.org">Develop Denver</a>, where they will be hosting a <a href="https://developdenver.org/panels/10">Show & Tell event!</a></p>
        <p>Anybody can hop up and share something they think is awesome. It could be your own work, but it doesn't have to be. It could be on CodePen (as that's useful for showing off front end code), but it doesn't have to be. Pretty much anything goes. Just no pitches, please.</p>
  <p>For example: Show us a cool library you just used for something. Show us a webpage you just launched. Show us a design pattern you really like. Show us a coding technique you find helpful. Show us some new software you bet we didn't know about.</p>
  <p>You don't need to be a fancy professional speaker. It's just a few minutes showing off an idea. The Tims will be your hosts, helping everything along.</p>
